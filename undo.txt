Strategy:

The basic unit of an object on the canvas is a dot. Each line , curve is formed by dots and the information (size, color, tool) of each dot is stored in different list with same index. 


To create an "line" or "curve" object. I record the # of dots for each action and store it on the undoStack.

Here's how I define an action:
	1. mouse down, mouse up => 1 dot.
	2. mouse down, mouse move, mouse up => curve or line.
	3. mouse down, mouse move, mouse leave => curve or line.

So here's how undoStack looks like [1,12,32,123, ...]

I want to implement linear undo. 

There are two buttons, undo and redo.
When user clicks undo, it will pops the element and push it to redoStack. 
When user clicks redo, it will pops the element and push it back to undoStack.
Whenever there is an new action, I flush the redoStack.

Here is the example how it works. 

Action:
			draw a line, draw a curve, undo,   redo,     draw a dot, undo,    draw a line
redoStack   [12]	     [12,15]       [12]    [12,15]   [12,15,1]   [12,15]  [12,15,21]
undoStack   []			 []			   [15]	   []		 []			 [1]	  []
